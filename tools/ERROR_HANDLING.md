# Audio Playback Error Handling

This document explains the implementation of error boundaries around the audio playback logic in the VoiceoverPanel component.

## Components Created

### 1. AudioErrorBoundary

The `AudioErrorBoundary` component is a React error boundary specifically designed to catch and handle errors that occur during audio playback. It:

- Catches runtime errors in its children components
- Displays a user-friendly error message
- Provides a "Try again" button to reset the error state
- Logs detailed error information to the console for debugging

Location: `components/errors/AudioErrorBoundary.tsx`

### 2. useAudioPlayer Hook

The `useAudioPlayer` custom hook abstracts audio playback functionality with robust error handling:

- Manages audio loading, playback, and progress tracking
- Handles errors during audio initialization and playback
- Provides controls for playing, pausing, and resetting errors
- Properly cleans up resources on unmount or when audio source changes

Location: `components/hooks/useAudioPlayer.ts`

## Implementation Details

### Error Handling Strategy

The implementation uses a dual approach to error handling:

1. **Error Boundary (React Component Errors)**

   - Catches errors in rendering or lifecycle methods
   - Prevents the entire component tree from unmounting
   - Provides fallback UI when errors occur

2. **Try-Catch & Error State (Runtime Errors)**
   - Handles audio-specific errors like failed loading or playback
   - Maintains error state to conditionally render appropriate UI
   - Includes error recovery mechanisms

### Benefits

This approach provides several advantages:

- **Resilience**: Audio playback issues won't crash the entire application
- **Feedback**: Users receive clear information when something goes wrong
- **Recovery**: Multiple options to recover from errors without page reload
- **Maintainability**: Audio playback logic is centralized and reusable

## Usage Example

The VoiceoverPanel component demonstrates proper usage:

```tsx
// Use the custom audio player hook
const {
  isPlaying,
  progress,
  error: audioError,
  audioRef,
  togglePlayback,
  resetError,
} = useAudioPlayer(voiceover?.url || undefined);

// Wrap audio controls with error boundary
<AudioErrorBoundary onReset={resetError}>
  {/* Audio player controls */}
</AudioErrorBoundary>;

// Optional: Display error outside boundary for additional context
{
  audioError && (
    <div className="mt-2 text-xs text-red-600">
      Error playing audio. Please try again.
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements for the error handling system:

1. Error telemetry to track audio playback issues
2. More granular error categorization and specialized error messages
3. Automatic retry mechanisms for transient network errors
4. Integration with a centralized application error tracking system
